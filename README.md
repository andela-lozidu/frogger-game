A frogger game
=======
This game is essentially to get the player to the water block without colliding with any enemy-bug. The player is enabled to move left, right, up and down. Anytime the player collides with a bug, the player returns to its initial starting position.
When the player gets to the water block, it also returns to its initial position.
